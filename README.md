# **edge device support**

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/README-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87-bigggreen)](./README_CN.md)

  The goal of this project is to help developers run EdgeX faster on embedded devices such as Raspberry Pi, Qualcomm Robotics RB3 Platform(SDA845), Inetl core i5(7th) EdgeStation, etc. Include the guide for:<br>
1. Initializing the device and install the operating system.
2. Running the EdgeX basic service
3. Connecting sensors by using the EdgeX Device Service (e.g. Modbus/Mqtt).
4. Getting sensor data 
5. Sending control commands
6. Creating the schedule and event
7. Using EMQ rulesEngin
8. Using DeviceSDK to create a device service.
9. Using the App Function SDK.
10. Following device's updates and EdgeX's updates.
11. Showing some interesting examples of EdgeX (like EdgeX management robots). 
12. Collect some good ideas from developers, feedback to the community in the community exchange of EdgeX.
